[94mWelcome to Uno on Console![0m
New game?
Yes - y
No - n
Errr, waht? Yes? Okay, new game it is

[3J[H[2JUno!

Choose game rules: 

[91m1. No Stacking[0m
Now you won't get 'no U-ed' by stacking 4 draw 4s anymore

[92m2. The 7-0 Rule[0m
7 to swap hand with someone else, 0 to force everyone swap directionwise

[93m3. Jump-in[0m
You can jump in whenever you want if you got the exact same card as on the discarded deck (not yet available)

[94m4. No bluffing[0m
If you have a card with the same color or number as the discarded pile, you cannot play wildcards anymore (not yet available)

Choose all the game mode you want to play, then enter them here, separated by a whitespace. Leave empty for no mod
Game modes are set

Loading...


No the game is not actually loading, i just want to waste your time xD
Though i've wasted mine more than you, waiting for this animation to get over, which lasts 2 seconds (i set it to 2 seconds in the code)
But since you're here, checkout Vanossgaming and Pewdiepie
Then go back and thank me later
WHAT?
