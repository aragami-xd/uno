#this is for the full build of the program, fresh from the ground up. if you want to save time, you can prebuild the game by running 'bash pre_build" once then 'bash final_build" every time you want to build a newer version
#trust me, that saves a lot of time. a full rebuild on my laptop, plugged in and high performance mode takes 30s, compare to barely over 10s for the pre build
#that number would become bigger if i don't plug in my laptop
