# uno
Uno on console. Need anything else? 
Oh and by console I mean computer console, the command prompt on Windows or Terminal on Linux and MacOS, not... game console like PS4 
and XB1 or the Switch (can I actually make it into a full program to run on those platforms?) 

Anyways, enjoy the game when it's done, which will probably take a while
