[94mWelcome to Uno on Console![0m
New game?
Yes - y
No - n
Errr, waht? Yes? Okay, new game it is

[3J[H[2JUno!

Choose game rules: 

[91m1. No Stacking[0m
Now you won't get 'no U-ed' by stacking 4 draw 4s anymore

[92m2. The 7-0 Rule[0m
7 to swap hand with someone else, 0 to force everyone swap directionwise

[93m3. Jump-in[0m
You can jump in whenever you want if you got the exact same card as on the discarded deck (not yet available)

[94m4. No bluffing[0m
If you can play a non-wildcard card, you cannot play wildcards anymore

Choose all the game mode you want to play, then enter them here, separated by a whitespace. Leave empty for no mod
Game modes are set

Player 0 name: Player 1 name: Player 2 name: Player 3 name: [3J[H[2JUno!

Loading...


No the game is not actually loading, i just want to waste your time xD
Though i've wasted mine more than you, waiting for this animation to get over, which lasts 2 seconds (i set it to 2 seconds in the code)
But since you're here, checkout Vanossgaming and Pewdiepie
Then go back and thank me later
WHAT?
